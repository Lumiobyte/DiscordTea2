# Discord Tea

## This bot is now deprecated
This version of the bot was used between 2020 and 2022. Since Discord's slash commands update and API restrictions on message content, this version of the code won't be usable on a verified bot account, and it likely won't run on the latest version of discord.py. The information below is kept for preservation purpose

## Host your own instance

Discord Tea is built using `discord.py` and can be easily run if Python 3.x is installed.

1. Simply edit [bot.py](bot.py) and set the TOKEN variable to a Discord bot token (it is recommended to generate a new bot in the [developer portal](https://discord.com/developers)).

2. Start the bot with:
```
python bot.py
```

## Commands

Discord Tea is still a work in progress so the command list is changing often!
The bot's developer Lumiobyte is working hard to implement new features when he gets the chance.

To see a list of the current commands, invite Discord Tea to a server and run:
```
tea!help
```
