## Host your own instance

Discord Tea is built using `discord.py` and can be easily run if Python 3.x is installed.

1. Simply edit [bot.py](bot.py) and set the TOKEN variable to a Discord bot token (it is recommended to generate a new bot in the [developer portal](https://discord.com/developers)).

2. Start the bot with:
```
python bot.py
```

## Commands

Discord Tea is still a work in progress so the command list is changing often!
The bot's developer Lumiobyte is working hard to implement new features when he gets the chance.

To see a list of the current commands, invite Discord Tea to a server and run:
```
tea!help
```

## Contributions

How can I help out Discord Tea?

1. Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/VtTW7xq)! Showing support of any kind is always a great way to contribute.
2. If you know Python, you can make contributions by forking the project and creating a pull request to merge your changes.
3. As stated above, Discord Tea is fully crowdsourced so we are always on the look-out for new sommeliers (tea makers). Visit our Discord server to apply.
